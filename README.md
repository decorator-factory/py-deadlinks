# deadlinks

(This is very WIP)

`deadlinks` is a program that finds broken links on your static website.

## TODO:

- [ ] Make the program runnable with a CLI
- [ ] Add option to disallow visiting certain IP ranges (SSRF protection)
- [ ] Handle rate-limiting (might require a more complex queue)
- [ ] Use proper logging instead of `print`s
- [ ] Add ignore rules to skip annoyances like JS-generated ids
